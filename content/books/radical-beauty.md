Feel more beautiful, healthy, and energized than you have in years! Now, a revolutionary new way of helping you realize the true beauty that is your birthright!

Deepak Chopra, a leading pioneer of integrative medicine and _New York Times_ bestselling author of _What Are You Hungry For?,_ and Kimberly Snyder, a Hollywood superstar nutritionist and _New York Times_ bestselling author of _The Beauty Detox Solution,_ offer an exciting and practical program to help transform you from the inside out. Through six pillars of healthy living that focus on internal and external nourishment, sleep, living naturally, avoiding excessive stress, and better understanding the relationship between emotions and inflammatory foods, the authors offer practical tips, tools, innovative routines, and foods that will allow you to achieve your highest potential of beauty and health.

Here is the latest information on foods to support your metabolism and how to best promote the circulation of beauty-boosting nutrients; the use of the most effective skin-care ingredients coupled with traditional Ayurvedic medicine; and how to work with your skin to balance your nervous system, thus slowing ageing. Further, Chopra and Snyder will show you how positive emotion-based living and peace foster natural and timeless beauty. All of this comes together to help you in developing a more healthy body and mind, increasing your natural glow, magnetic presence, and radiant vitality.

With powerful DIY home skincare and beauty remedies and treatments to address everything from acne to dry skin and wrinkles, techniques to promote your natural beauty by syncing with the power of rhythms found in nature, strategic dietary tips, and delicious recipes, _Radical Beauty_ will help you feel more confident, achieve more beautifully smooth illuminating skin, healthy hair, bright eyes, and--perhaps best of all--the ability to tap into and be in touch with the true beauty that is already within you.
